Q4/- What are the different types of Maven repositories ?

Answer : - 
		a)Local - 
			The Local repository is a directory on the computer where Maven runs. 
			It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have 
			not yet released.
		b)Remote - 
			Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository, accessed by a variety 
			of protocols such as file:// and https://. These repositories might be a truly 
			remote repository set up by a third party to provide their artifacts for downloading 
			(for example, repo.maven.apache.org). Other "remote" repositories may be internal 
			repositories set up on a file or HTTP server within your company, used to share 
			private artifacts between development teams and for releases.
