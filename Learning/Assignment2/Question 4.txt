Explain about the ORM.

	Ans- ORM is short for Object Relational Mapping. In a nutshell, an ORM framework is a program written in an object-oriented language 
	     (such as PHP, Java, C#, etc.) that wraps around a relational database.


What are the benefits of the ORM approach over the
JDBC approach.

	Ans- a) So, first and foremost, you get to write in the language that you already know. Directly writing SQL queries can be difficult in some 
	     circumstances since they are complex. So, to keep fluency, we use ORM, which allows us to write in the language we are familiar with.

	     b) Second, it separates your application logic from SQL or any other database query.

	     c) ORMs also theoretically allow an application to switch between different relational databases. A developer may, for example, 
		 use SQLite for local development and MySQL for production. With few code changes, a production application might be moved from 
		 MySQL to PostgreSQL.

	     d) Also,  for heavy database usages, such as creating 10+ tables and many queries in them, ORM is recommended since it reduces code, 
		 improves code understanding for you and your team members, and makes your application faster and easier to maintain.
