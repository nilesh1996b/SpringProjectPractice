Limitations Of JDBC:

	a) JDBC persistence logic supports SQL statements based programing, these are database s/w dependent statements. 
	   So JDBC persistence logic is database s/w dependent persistence logic.That's means if we want to change database 
	   s/w in the middle of project development it is not possible,we have to re develop JDBC persistence logic for other database s/w's.

	Examples : -Solution:To overcome this problem we have to go for ORM -framework s/w's based persistence logic (ex: Hibernate, ibaties, toplink,..etc).

	b) By default JDBC ResultSet object is not serializable, so we can not send that object over the network.To overcome this RowSet 
	   introduced but that is not supporting for all JDBC drivers.

	Examples : -Solution:We have to take the support of DTO(Data Transfer Object)/VO(Value Object) design pattern.
