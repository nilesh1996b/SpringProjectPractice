Q2/- Differentiate between Hibernate and JPA.

	A) Hibernate - 
			a) Hibernate is described in org.hibernate package.
			b) Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that is used to save the Java objects in the relational database system.
			c) Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Hence, the common standard which is given by JPA is followed by Hibernate.
			d) It is used in mapping Java data types with SQL data types and database tables.
			e) As an object-oriented query language, it uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL) to execute database operations.
			f) To create Session instances, it uses SessionFactory interface.
			g) To make, read, and remove actions for instances of mapped entity classes, it uses Session interface. It acts as a runtime 
			   interface between a Java application and Hibernate.
			

	A) JPA - 
			a) JPA is described in javax.persistence package.
			b) It describes the handling of relational data in Java applications.           
			c) It is not an implementation. It is only a Java specification.
			d) As an object-oriented query language, it uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL) to execute database operations.
			e) As an object-oriented query language, it uses Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) to execute database operations.
			f) To interconnect with the entity manager factory for the persistence unit, it uses EntityManagerFactory interface. Thus, 
			   it gives an entity manager.
			g) To make, read, and remove actions for instances of mapped entity classes, it uses EntityManager interface. 
			   This interface interconnects with the persistence condition.
